<h2 id="costs" class="nolinks">Startup costs</h2>
<p>Quality photography equipment is notoriously expensive, so you’ll want to start off with the minimum: Buying a $5,000 lens doesn’t make sense if your business isn’t making money yet. Many professional photographers say to plan on budgeting about $10,000 to start your photography business.</p>
<p>According to professional photographer <a href="http://austendiamondphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austen Diamond</a>, “building slow and smart” will help you stay nimble. Allow the organic growth of your business to fund gear improvements, and avoid debt if possible, he said.</p>
<p>Based on interviews with professional photographers, here is a basic budget for starting your business, not including studio or office space. All prices are yearly estimates or one-time purchases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cameras: $1,500 to $2,000 each</li>
<li>Multiple lenses: $1,000+ each</li>
<li>Two flashes: $700</li>
<li>Multiple memory cards: $50+ each</li>
<li>Two external drives: $120 each (keep one backup off-site)</li>
<li>Computer or laptop with sufficient memory: $2,000</li>
<li>Website (<a href="http://www.wix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wix</a>, <a href="http://www.photoshelter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhotoShelter</a>, <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmugMug</a> and/or <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squarespace</a>): $60+</li>
<li><a href="http://creative.adobe.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightroom and Photoshop</a> subscription: $120 per year</li>
<li>Business licenses: $150 (varies)</li>
<li>Insurance: $600 per year (varies)</li>
<li>Accounting: $300+ per year (varies)</li>
<li>Contracts: Free to $1,000+ (varies)</li>
<li>Online proof gallery, such as <a href="http://www.shootproof.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShootProof</a>: $120 per year</li>

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised the alert level to four out of five, warning that a hazardous eruption could take place anytime, as authorities have evacuated tens of thousands of people from the area. An estimated $10 million worth of crops and livestock have been damaged by the on-going eruption, according to the country&#8217;s agriculture department.

<p>As soon as I arrived, ash fall had mixed with rain, turning into mud. Within seconds, visibility was gone and the wipers of my car windshield were broken. I left my car and ran to the lakeside, where residents were looking on as the volcano shot up a giant ash column.</p>
<p>Evening was about to fall and I made the decision to travel to higher ground as soon as possible, an important choice, I would learn the next day. That night after I left, plenty of residents were left stranded in Talisay with no food and water. Houses and buildings were destroyed by the heavy ash fall, and rescuers had a difficult time evacuating those who remained as roads were rendered impassable. The devastation caused by the eruption was getting clearer. I would have been one of those stranded if I hadn’t left sooner.</p>
